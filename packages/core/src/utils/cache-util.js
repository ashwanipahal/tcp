   Redux cache is a library used to prevent api calls when correct data exists in redux already.
   It has a TTL based cache validation which defaults to 10 mins along with functionality of forcefully bursting a specific reducer cache.

   This utility over-rides the redux cache to provide as a wrapper for future.
   Idea is to use same cache utility for both redux and any other storage mechanism like local storage for api.
