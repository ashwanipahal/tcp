  // SPACING
  // ELEM_SPACING - This spacing is defined from the mininum to maximum that can be used inside an individual
  // component for both padding and margin.

  // LAYOUT_SPACING - TThe layout scale is used for arranging components and other UI parts into a full page layout.
  // It has larger increments that are used to control the density of a design.
  // Use the smaller layout tokens to create more dense compositions and direct relationships.
  // Use the larger tokens to increase the amount of white space and to disassociate sections.

  // The spacing below are taken from the UI stylesheet. If you find you need a spacing that doesn't
  // exist here, it's likely the design should be updated to match an use spacing, or the spacing needs
  // to be added to the stylesheet. Please speak to a designer first before adding here and
  // PLEASE DO NOT JUST ADD SPACING BELOW BECAUSE IT'S IN A DESIGN :)
